Summary: This interface includes headers of the most basic
  instance methods necessary for implementing a working Hand
  class (which represents a player's hand of cards in a card
  game). Since the meld classes Set and Run both share a lot
  of functionality with the implementation of a hand, this
  class is extended by MeldInterface". It also extends the
  Comparable interface, to guarantee that methods for comparing
  Hands, Sets and Runs among themselves will be implemented.
