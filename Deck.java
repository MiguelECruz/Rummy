Summary: This files defines public class "Deck", each instance of
  which is used to represent a deck of playing cards, this through
  a LinkedList of card objects. The class counts with one constructor
  and 14 methods, all of them instance-bound: one for automatically
  filling the deck with all possible cards/combinations of suits
  and ranks from the Card class ("fillDeck()"), one for shuffling the
  deck ("shuffleDeck()"), 2 for adding (overloaded as "addCard()")
  and 4 for removing ("dealCard()" and 3 overloaded versions of
  "removeCard()") cards, one for peeking at the card at the bottom
  of the deck ("peek()"), two related to the deck's amount of cards
  ("getSizeOfDeck()" and "isEmpty()"), one for expressing it as a
  String ("toString()") and two for clearing it out, with or without
  filling it again (overloaded as "restoreDeck()").
